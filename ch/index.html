chase money
become so rich
that you can buy
the entire world

chase success
become so successful
the world is forced
to change the definition
of success
to your name

chase love
chase respect 
chase fame 
chase glory
chase spirituality
chase mindfulness
chase peace
chase freedom

chase
till there is
nothing
left to chase

this is not
sarcasm
i mean it
truly

for only when
you’ve got
everything
there is to get
from the world
only then
will you see
the truth
that nothing
in the world
can satisfy
the human
in you

some of you
will read this
and say

you are right
it’s all useless
success
money
fame
what the point
we’re all going to die
right?

wrong 
for you understood
the words above
intellectually

because all humans live
from the <a href="../pom/">prison of mind</a>  
the mind deceptively
flips everything
to suit itself
while making
the human
feel clever

truth is simple

the reason
chases won’t satisfy
the human

is because
they are empty
it’s as simple
as that

an empty thing
cannot satisfy
for it doesn’t have
anything in it
to satisfy

it’s like
you’ve successfully
navigated 
a complex maze
to reach the center
only to find it empty
there is no prize
there is however
a new chase

how does that 
make you feel?

you might 
understand this
today
tomorrow
a decade from now
or never

the only chance
you have
is to chase

chase everything
you want to chase
as quickly
as you can
navigate the maze
reach the center
see if it makes you
satisfied
without any further need
to chase
