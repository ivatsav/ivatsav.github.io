<p>
have you ever felt
you lost 
track of time

when you were playing
your favourite sport
when you were watching
your favourite movie
when you were lost
in an activity

a sense of timelessness

what happened there?
<a href="../y/">you</a>…disappeared

that something
which was left
didn’t exist with
thoughts
<a href="../ba/">baggage</a>
<a href="../pom/">mind</a>

that something
which was left
returned to <a href="../th/">there</a>
where they were
<a href="../tmch/">complete</a>

but then someone tapped
on the shoulder
and told you
the time

suddenly
you
reappeared
with all of <em>you's</em>
thoughts
baggage
mind

<em>you</em is amazed
so much time
had passed
during that activity

<em>you</em> tries to
piece together
what happened

but<em>you</em> can’t seem
to remember
what happened
its vague
its hazy
its unexplainable

all <em>you</em> can feel
is for that
brief duration
time ceased to exist

it was magic
