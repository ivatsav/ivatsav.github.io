<p>
every religion has two things to offer
reward and punishment

you are born a human
the most noble form of life
you take good steps
you get small-small rewards
you will get to experience them
while you are alive
on this earth
but since you are human
you will die at some point
but that is not the end, no sir
after death you will get ultimate reward
heaven, paradise, moksha

but if you take bad steps
you get small-small punishments
you will get to experience them
while you are alive
on this earth
since you are human
you will die at some point
but that is not the end, no sir
after death you will get ultimate punishment
hell, naraka, rebirth 

good and bad
right and wrong
moral and immoral
ethical and unethical
are all concepts
created
by societies

they don't exist
in reality

the reason
you don't do bad
or the reason
you do good
is not because
of some book
or some law
it is because
it is in
your nature
and
what is in your nature
is natural
it is not acquired
through
a <a href="../sub/">subscription</a> 

but religions
will never get it
because
all religions spend 
all their time 
circling around
the cosmetics
for they are
too attached 
to their gods
and it is precisely 
because of that
they never become 
one with god

for true <a href="../r/">devotion</a>
can only begin
with
the annihilation
of the self
