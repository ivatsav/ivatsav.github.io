<body>
<p>
when you see 
<a href="../t/">truth</a>
in everything

everything
will
truly
change

the world
and its causes
will not interest you

the people
and their <a href="../p/">problems</a>
will not engage you

the mind
and its nonsense
will not arrest you

soon

your voice will change
your words will change
your walk will change

anxiety, depression
fear, <a href="../an/">anger</a>
suffering
and even
<a href="../hiam/">happiness</a>
will mean nothing
to you

all your <a href="../ch/">chases</a>
all your hopes
all your needs
all your choices
all your <a href="../b/">beliefs</a>
all your identities
will disappear

it is not that
you will become
a stone
with
no emotion
no expression
discernible
on your face
or in your heart

it is that
you will become
lucid
see and experience
everything
without <a href="../ba/">baggage</a>

all emotions
will continue
to arise
but
the degree
and 
the duration
of these
will shorten
over time

you might have
lived on autopilot
for days, decades
when these emotions 
arose within you
but now
they will be reduced
to a breath

neither happy
nor sad
neither good
nor bad
neither this
nor that

you will experience
everything
but accumulate
nothing

you will exist
with nothing
but still have
everything
at your command

when you see
truth
in everything

you will becomeâ€¦god
