<p>
almost all humans 
pursue success
to experience 
the pleasure 
of becoming successful
this is impure

impurity 
is neither wrong nor right
its just that 
all pleasure 
leads to pain

the remaining <a href="../car/">rare</a> humans 
pursue a craft 
to perfect themselves
this is pure
purity 
is neither wrong nor right
purity is not an ideal
it is simply effective
utilitarian
for purity 
neither leads 
to pleasure nor pain
it only nourishes

the former desire
was impure
because
it came
from the <a href="../pom/">mind</a>
the later desire
was pure
because
it came
from the human

the one
who sees
the difference
between
the two
<a href="../tdys/">sees</a>
the truth
the one
who doesnâ€™t
will <a href="../sub/">subscribe</a>
and <a href="../ahl/">suffer</a>
