humans are born
they subscribe
they die

the subscriptions
humans
subscribe to
are useless
and detrimental
to the humans

but humans
have no say
because
as soon as
they are born
the world forces them
to acquire the mind
and thus
the subscriptions begin

no matter what
the humans do
they cannot resist
the urge
to subscribe

to their god
to their country
to their caste
to their family
to their career
to hope
to faith
to belief
to happiness
to sports teams
to movie stars
to political parties
to hard work
to smart work
to discipline
to motivation
to success
to productivity
to spirituality
to mindfulness
to materialism
to minimalism
to capitalism
to communism
to socialism
to idealism
to humanism
to asceticism
to masochism
to masculism
to feminism
to toxic masculinity
to toxic femininity
to money
to charity
to chastity
to promiscuity
to pornography
to divinity

everything
the world has to offer
is a subscription
and
there is no end to it

because humans
live within their minds
more often than not
the mind subscribes
for the human
in the guise
of selling it
as noble
as good
as necessary

if one has experienced
all their life
through these subscriptions
how will the human know
that they were once free
without any subscriptions

the influence 
of these subscriptions
is so deep and so wide
it takes over
the entirety
of human's life

they don't realise
that these subscriptions
have become their reality
their identity

it engulfs the human
so deeply
that there is no human left
there is only
the subscriptions
