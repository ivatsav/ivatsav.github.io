<p>
everything we do
is an <a href="../ac/">act</a>
we play
a set of characters
we come to identify
with those characters
we grow <a href="../at/">attached</a>
to those characters
we go so deep
into this method acting
we don’t know
who is the human
and who is the <a href="../y/">character</a>
somewhere down the line
acting becomes a job
we are tired
of remembering our lines
we are tired
of remembering
which character to play
at which situation
no matter how beautiful
the script
we don’t feel like acting anymore
we shed all the make-up
we applied over the years
to get into the character
to look like the character
we realise all this acting
was a waste of time and energy
none of it mattered
and then we die
