<p>
everything we do
is an act
we play
a set of characters
we come to identify
with those characters
we grow attached
to those characters
we go so deep
into this method acting
we don’t know
who is the human
and who is the character
somewhere down the line
acting becomes a job
we are tired
of remembering our lines
and which character to play
at which situation
no matter how beautiful
the script
we don’t feel like acting anymore
we shed all the make-up
we applied over the years
to get into the character
to look like the character
we realise all this acting
was a waste of time and energy
none of it mattered
and then we die
