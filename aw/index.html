<p>
the desire
to get away
from all forms of social media
led me to this place

a place with
no ads
no trackers
no analytics
no likes
no comments
no followers
no communication
and more importantly
no author

i searched for many phrases
that would befit
the words
that are written in these pages
either they were unavailable
or not applicable
or not affordable
in the end
i resigned to the idea
of using my name 
as the domain
but
the words written
on these pages
are not mine
i have not written them
i do not own them
i am not attached to them
the words simply write themselves
...through a human
