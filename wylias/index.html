(Q) why does it feel like I have to struggle for 98% of my time so I can find peace for 2%?
(A) because you are <a href="../at/">attached</a>

(Q) "because I am attached?" what does that even mean?
(A) almost everyone in this world is attached...to their identities
you are attached 
to your country
to your religion 
to your caste
to your family
to your <a href="../is/">"-isms"</a>
you are attached 
because you identity
and because you identity
every time someone questions your identity
you feel attacked
because you identify
you have expectations
because you have expectations
you create a preference
for sometimes your expectations will be met 
sometimes they will not
so now, you are seeking a certain type of outcome
you are stuck in this preference
a like towards something
a dislike towards something
this creates conflict
so you search online
to find answers for your conflicts
eventually you will find yourself
in front of a guru, a baba, a yogi
and this guru will tell you
to just be
be present
so you do it, you try to be present
sometimes you'll be able to do it
sometimes you'll find it impossible
you motivate yourself
you discipline yourself
and somehow find a way
to be present
and for a few days
you will be free
from all forms of conflict
you will find peace and happiness
but then
suddenly everything falls apart
you once again find yourself
in all forms of conflict
in the end you resign to the idea
that this is what life is like

(Q) wait a minute, this is exactly how I feel like, all the time. are you saying, it does not have to be like this, that there is a way?
(A) yes, but there is no way
the way is the obstacle
but you will not get it

(Q) so, what do I do?
(A) there is nothing to do

(Q) "nothing to do?" but I don't want to be like this, I don't want to suffer, I want peace, everlasting peace.
(A) you will never find peace
because you live within your mind

(Q) what do you mean by living within your mind? what is mind?
(A) mind is preference 
  mind is thought 
  mind is everything you think you are 
  but precisely not

(Q) tell me more
(A) imagine you are walking your dog and it is tied to a leash which is attached to your arm 
every time the dog moves, you move
the dog finds something
it gets excited, agitated
it wants to rush around, jump around, do all kinds of gymnastics 
and because you are also tied to the dog
it feels like you and the dog are one and the same

(Q) and it is not a pleasant feeling
(A) but if you detach the leash and let go of the dog
you take a seat on the park bench and watch it from a distance
now, you don't feel like you and the dog are one and the same

(Q) so what are you saying?
(A) detach the leash

(Q) but if I do that, how will I experience everything, will I not go mad, if I stop being mindful of everything?
(A) who is this that has gotten this thought
is it the human or is it the mind?

(Q) uh.. the mind?
(A) we are all full
full of our minds
we must become mindless
not mindful

(Q) never heard someone put it that way. how can I be mindless?
(A) when you've experienced the burden of living within your mind
the answer will find you
until then, you will oscillate
from pleasure to pain
from hope to despair
from past regrets to future expectations
