<p>
humans are obsessed
with seeking
advice

humans will travel
the entire world
they will search
the entire internet
to find

specific gurus
specific experts
specific books
specific philosophies
to gain
a new way
of thinking
a new way
of tackling
their problems

they will
listen
watch
take notes
arrange the notes
colour code the notes
backup their notes

they will 
search and join
groups
communities
clubs
that deal with
their kind of problems

they will meet
fellow humans
who suffer
from same problems

they will
share their notes
with each other
discuss
bond
and
form relationships
based on
their common problems

this is how
humans spend
their entire lives

collecting the advice
arranging the advice
reconfiguring the advice
on how to properly solve
their problems
...
to never follow it

because
humans seek advice
not to solve their problems
but to talk about
how much advice
theyâ€™ve acquired
