when you are at work
you want to be at home
when you are at home
you want to be at work
when you are with friends
you want to be alone
when you are alone
you want to be with friends
when you are single
you want to be in a relationship
when you are in a relationship
you want to be single
when you are a kid
you want to be an adult
when you are an adult
you want to be a kid
when you have nothing
you want everything
when you have everything
you want nothing

this is your life
experienced
from
the prison of mind
