<p>
almost all humans
are broken people
looking for missing parts
in the other

but two broken people
cannot complete
each other

only when 
both are whole
complete
without any need
for another
only then
they will
live together
in peace
in harmony

that relationship
will be pure

as illogical 
as it may sound
only when
you don't need
each other
will you be able
to love
each other

for only when
you don't need
anything
will you be able
to give
everything
completely

total surrender

if it is not full today
in this moment
it will never be full
never

if you marry
with a hope
that you can have
someone
to love
and to be loved

<a href="../iyn/">if you need</a>
your spouse
to dress
a certain way
talk
a certain way
behave
a certain way

if you need
your kids
to listen to you
to respect you
to follow you

you will experience
a lifetime
of
<a href="../p/">problems</a>
and
compromise

this is the reality
of all relationships
and marriages

for
almost all humans 
get married
even before
they understand
themselves
forget about
understanding
their spouse
or their kids

these two
broken people
will spend
a lifetime
trying to change
each other
but the parts
won't fit

these two
broken people
will become
parents
never having understood
themselves

these two
broken people
will <a href="../apdtk/">destroy</a>
their kids
and guide them
on a path
of destroying
their own
future progeny

even if you
somehow
manage
to live a life
without <a href="../sub/">subscriptions</a>  
without <a href="../ch/">chases</a> 
without being
<a href="../pom/">a prisoner of your mind</a>

the chances
of two 
needless
hopeless
choiceless
mindless
individuals
finding each other
is almost zero

...

"hey, listen
i donâ€™t have time
for all this
tell me what can I do
if I'm already married 
and with kids?"

<a href="../io/">instead of</a> 
trying to change
your spouse
your kids
see from where
the desire
to change arises

"will it help?"
not for <a href="../y/">you</a>
