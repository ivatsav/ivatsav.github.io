<p>
almost all humans 
use hard work
as an excuse
for their eventual failure

“hey, at least i tried, right?”
“it was not meant to be”
“what can i do, right?”

for humans
are not interested
in results
they are interested
in showing
the world
how much
they’ve struggled

they use 
hard work
failure
struggle
as a badge
of honour
and it doesn't help
that the world
applauds them

for the world
is not interested
in humans
it is interested
in selling
<a href="../sub/">subscriptions</a>

rare is the human 
who is not interested
in badges, labels
or what the world
has to sell

rare is the human
who is not interested 
in journeys

rare is the human
who wants to arrive
at the <a href="../aot/">destination</a>
