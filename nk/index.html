subscribing
is fine
socialising
is fine
social media
is fine
marriage
is fine
having kids
is fine
money
is fine
career
is fine
experimenting
with things
to see
what works
for you
is fine

only if 
you know
who you are
and
what you want

the problem is
almost all humans
donâ€™t know
who they are
and
what they want

for they live
through
the <a href="../pom/">prison of mind</a>

not knowing
themselves
humans
enter
the world
to seek things

not knowing
themselves
humans
blindly
<a href="../sub/">subscribe</a>
<a href="../so/">socialise</a>
and
<a href="../ch/">chase</a>

not knowing
themselves
humans
get
<a href="../at/">attached</a>
to everything

not knowing
themselves
humans
create
<a href="../p/">problems</a>

and then
wonder
why
their life
is a <a href="../wylias/">struggle</a>

the world
can give
worldly things
which is what
the average human wants
but
only when 
the humans know
who they are
and
what they want

go blind
into the world
and it will
burn you alive
