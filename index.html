  <p>this is a madman
in the middle 
of the street
speaking to no one
speaking to everyone

a mad man
in search
of truth

don't read
the words
on this website
they will make
no sense

for this is not for you

if you still
want to read

know this

these words
won't help you
but they might
confuse you
disturb you
unsettle you

because
these aren't
answers
these are
questions

enter only 
if you are ready
to question everything

if not
it is best
to ignore

just like
you'd ignore
the madman
on the streets</p>
