<p>
either you know 
or 
you don’t know
belief is the middleman 
who says 
“i know, you don’t know”
this is how 
gurus, babas, yogis, 
motivational speakers 
self-help books
and snake oil salesmen
are born

the rational human
might question
"can one really live
without believing in anything?"
i’ll say this
the only things one can believe 
are the things that require no belief

"which is what?"
the things that one has experienced

that which one has experienced 
needs no middlemen
even god
cannot take that away
from you

if it’s a problem
of the world
like 
how to repair something
how to install something
by all means
seek a guru

but if it’s 
an otherworldly
problem
like
how to end suffering
how to find peace
how to be free
then
no guru can help

for
that guru
has more<a href="../p/">problems</a>
than you
he has to maintain
his beard
he has to maintain
his fancy robe
he has to maintain
his social media
he has to fill
his speeches
with the right amount
of intellect, fun
and
viral material
so he is 
always trending

for otherworldly problems
you need otherworldly solutions
you cannot seek
human help

you have to go alone

explore
experiment
see what happens
only in that
experience
you will find
the root
of your problem

don’t believe me?
good
