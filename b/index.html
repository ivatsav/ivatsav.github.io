<p>
either you know  
or  
you don’t know  
belief is the middleman  
who says  
“i know, you don’t know”  
this is how  
gurus, babas, yogis,  
motivational speakers  
self-help books  
and snake oil salesmen  
are born  

the rational human  
might question  
"can one really live  
without believing in anything?"  
i’ll say this  
the only things one can believe  
are the things that require no belief  

"which is what?"  
the things that one has experienced  

that which one has experienced  
needs no middlemen  
even god  
cannot take that away  
from you  

if it’s a problem  
of the world  
like  
how to repair something  
how to install something  
by all means  
seek a guru  

but if it’s  
an otherworldly  
problem  
like  
how to end suffering  
how to find peace  
how to be free  
then  
no guru can help  

for  
that guru  
has more <a href="../p/">problems</a>  
than you  
he has to maintain  
his beard  
he has to maintain  
his fancy robe  
he has to maintain  
his social media  
he has to fill  
his speeches  
with the right amount  
of intellect, fun  
and  
viral material  
so he is  
always trending  

for otherworldly problems  
you need otherworldly solutions  
you cannot seek  
human help  

you have to go alone  

explore  
experiment  
see what happens  
only in that  
experience  
you will find  
the root  
of your problem  

don’t believe me?  
good
