<p>
there is no book  
you can read  
there is no podcast  
you can listen to  
there is no guru  
you can seek advice from  
there is no god  
you can pray to

to find the cure  
for your problems

as long as there is a <em>you</em>
there will be need  
there will be hope  
there will be attachment  
there will be suffering  
there will be problems

but how can you be <em>you</em>  
without being <em>you?</em>

when you have seen
enough of <em>you</em>
when you have grown
tired of <em>you</em>
when you no longer
need <em>you</em> 
when you no longer  
want to waste  
even a second  
of what little time  
you have left  
in fixing
<em>you's</em> problems

only then  
will you truly see  
that <em>you</em> is the problem  
only then  
the <em>you</em> you think you are  
will disappear  
and the human you are  
will reappear  

until then  
you will remain <em>you</em>  
until then  
you will fix <em>you's</em> problems  
because
let's be honest
you are in love 
with <em>you</em>
