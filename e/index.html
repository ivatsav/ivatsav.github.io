<p>
you end your life
the day you enter school
the moment you say,
“good morning, teacher”
your conditioning begins

you are told
you all are same
so don’t be different
behave like everyone else
you are told to comb your hair
in the same way
you are told to wear
the same clothes
you are told to read
the same books
you are told to play
the same games
you are told to score
the same grades

for a decade and a half
you do this
without missing a beat
trying to be the same
as everybody else

finally, you step out
into the world
filled with 
your baggage
of hopes
dreams
ambitions
feeling you were successful in studies
feeling you will be successful in life

how does the world greet you?
“there are thousands of people just like you, 
why should I hire you, how are you different?”
