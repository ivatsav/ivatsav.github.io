<p>
let us assume
there exists
an entity

omnipotent
omniscient
almighty
all-encompassing

whom we all call 
god

that god
who created
this universe
in a span
of few seconds

let us assume
that god
really exists

now
place your hand
on your heart
and answer me

do you really think
that god is so dumb
to fall for your
coins, coconuts
and pradakshina?

humans 
are not interested
in god
they are interested
in what the god
can do for them

humans 
donâ€™t pray to god
they transact with god
if someone told them
god doesn't have UPI
humans will stop going to temples

understand this

to appease 
an otherworldly entity
you need to have
an otherworldly devotion

so get real
keep your coins
eat your coconuts
do your pradakshina for fitness

approach god
not with vanity
but with purity
