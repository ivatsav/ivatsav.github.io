<p>
there are two kinds of humans
those who add
whether its people, possessions or pursuits
the more they add
the more they feel complete
and the second kind
those who remove
whether its people, possessions or pursuits
the more they remove
the more they feel complete

both are one and the same
because adding and removing are needs
and that which one needs is one's prison
if one needs to get rid of everything one owns 
to be labelled as a minimalist
then minimalism is one's prison
if one needs to add as many things as one can find 
to be labelled as a maximalist
then maximalism is one's prison

prison is prison
labels don't change anything
if one <a href="../tdys/">sees</a>
that neither minimalism nor maximalism
or any other "-ism" 
can give one anything
if one realises this
one will naturally 
give up the <a href="../ch/">chase</a>
and when one stops chasing
<a href="../f/">a path emerges</a>
a path that leads one to <a href="../go/">peace</a>
which is what one truly wants deep down

a place 
where <a href="../th/">everything is settled</a>
