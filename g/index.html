<p>
he more chaos 
there is in society
the more security 
the individual seeks 

individuals who seek 
the same kind of security 
find each other

this is how 
a group is formed

the group elects a leader
the leader who promises
the most security

the leader creates a system
as the group grows
the leader alters the system
to make the leader sacrosanct
and the individual irrelevant

any individual 
who questions
the system
or the leader
is silenced

the group
that was born 
to give security 
to the individual
sacrifices the individual 
and uses that sacrifice 
to further strengthen itself

the sacrificed individuals
become disillusioned 
and move away 
from the group

they wander and meet
other sacrificed individuals
they form a group 
and elect a leader
the leader 
who promises 
the most security

the more chaos 
there is in society
the more security 
the individual seeks
â€¦
the more it benefits
the controllers
of society
