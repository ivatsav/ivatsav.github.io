<p>
siddhartha wasn't a buddhist
and it is precisely
because of that
he became buddha
every god attained godhood
precisely because
they didn't practice some rituals
they became gods
because they truly understood
and mastered themselves
so the next time
you hop on
the latest trend
from your favourite <a href="../sh/">guru</a>
ask yourself this question
do you want a lifetime of practice?
or do you want to become <a href="../go/">god</a>?
there is no right answer
but knowing who you are
and knowing what you want
is important
it is the beginning of wisdom
there are many more levels after that
