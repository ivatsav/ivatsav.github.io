<p>
this is not for <a href="../y/">you</a>

if you read this
i am almost certain
that you will
misunderstand
the words
on this page

if you still
want to pursue
do so
at your own peril

...

you’ve destroyed
everything
you’ve come
in contact with
and
you will
continue to destroy
till you die

your relationships
are fake
you are always
hiding
your true feelings

you have 
held them shut
so deep 
inside you
that you have nightmares
that one day
you will be
exposed
that one day
the people
in your life
will abandon you

this fear
is so deep
and so wide
it has 
consumed you 
entirely

for as long
as you can remember
you have compromised
with your parents
with your spouse
with your kids
with your career
with your friends
with your neighbours
with your government
with your god 

everything 
that you have
has arisen
as a result
of compromise

you have never gone
to the edge
of the world
to get
what you want
you have always
settled
for a compromise

this has had
consequences
that
only you know of

those
consequences
have
teared you apart

the cracks
are so deep
even you 
can’t see them
forget about
sharing them
with
another human

the rational human
might say
“what is wrong
in compromise
everyone does it
it is in fact essential
to compromise
if you want to 
co-exist
in a society”

the rational human
might say
“if you
don’t compromise
you will alienate everyone
no human
would want
to live with you”

what <em>you</em> are they talking about?

maybe
they don’t see it
but you know
you have died
long back
you only exist
as a robot
with
preprogrammed
actions

understand

i don’t write
these words
to hurt you
i don’t write
these words
as a superior human
i was once blind
living a life
of
compromise

only
seeing
the truth
opened
my eyes
now
i cannot
close them

this is not
an <a href="../ad/">advice</a>
this is not
a recommendation
this is not
for anyone
because
every human
has
their
reasons
for
the way
they lead
their life

i will end with this

is <a href="../st/">seeing the truth</a>
about oneself
and speaking it
with sincerity
more difficult
than living
a life of compromise
while lying to your self?
