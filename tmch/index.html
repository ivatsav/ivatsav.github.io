<p>
the child 
is the most
complete
human
there is

it is all downhill
from here

the child
never lives
in the past
the child
never lives
in the future
the child
is always
present

when the child plays
the child plays
the child is not
trying to save the toy
so they can play again
tomorrow

when the child cries
the child cries
they are not crying
for a thing
you did
in the past
or the problems
they might have to solve
in the future

the child is
the rawest
the wildest
the purest

the child is complete

then why is it
that the world
is hell bent
on <a href="../e/">teaching</a>
the child

why is it
that the world
is hell bent
on taming
on domesticating
on conditioning
the child

why is it
that the world
is hell bent
on destroying
their rawness
their wildness
their pureness

if anything,
it is the world
who has to learn
from the child

we are all
born complete
then we <a href="../sub/">subscribe</a>
to the ways of the world
and wonder
why our life
is a <a href="../wylias/">struggle</a>
