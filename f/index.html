<p>
the day
one is ready
to die
is the day
one has lived

almost all humans
fear death
not because
death is final
but because
they have 
not yet lived
fully

there is always
something
left to <a href="../ch/">chase</a>

the unsuccessful dream
of becoming successful
and spend their lives
in that chase

the successful
who have built
their palaces
begin another chase
to keep themselves busy

this is <a href="../ahl/">a human's life</a>
it does not matter
if your pockets
are heavy or empty
money solves
money’s problems
but it cannot imprison 
<a href="../pom/">the prisoners of mind</a> 

you could
buy the world
and the mind
will whisper
”not enough
not until you
own the stars”

but what if
you lived
as if you are
ready to die
not tomorrow
not tonight
but now
right now

because
there is nothing 
left to chase

before you ask
“is that possible?”
the answer is yes

for the rare 
it only takes
<a href="../iotam/">a moment</a>
for some
only when they know
their <a href="../dod/">date of death</a>
for most
never at all

before you ask
“how can I…”

look closely
at a day in your life

what thoughts arise?
what voices fill your ears?
what words leave your lips?

if you’re still here
the answer is…<a href="../th/">there</a>
