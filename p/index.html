<p>
humans entertain problems
humans seek problems
humans chase problems
for
problems give humans
a reason
to look forward to
a purpose
to achieve something
a meaning
to make sense
of their life

it is for this reason
the human
might outwardly seem
depressed
while saying
his life is beset
with problems
but inwardly
(and this is
hidden so deep
the human himself
doesn’t know
he feels this way)
inwardly
he wants
problems
he loves
his problems
he craves
bigger problems

in fact
the truth is
he fears
the days
there are no problems
for on those days
the human has to deal
with himself
with his thoughts

if you know you know

a humans life
is full
of problems
not because
they can’t be solved
but because
humans have played
the role of a victim
for so long
it is hard
to imagine a life
without it
because
what will the humans do
if there are no problems
to solve?
