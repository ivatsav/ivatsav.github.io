<p>
the purpose of a self help book
and a self help guru 
is to create more self 
that needs help

5-step this
10-step that

breathe in
breathe out

morning routine
evening routine
nightly routine

meditate
be mindful
be present

daily to do
weekly to do
monthly to do

build habits
positive thinking
negative thinking

quarterly plan
yearly plan
five year plan

plan this
practice that

all books 
all podcasts
all interviews
all discourses
are filled
with answers
advices
suggestions
practices
habits
methods
tips 
tricks
hacks

if these really worked
there would just be one book
just one podcast
just one interview
just one discourse
telling us what to do

there wouldn't be 
a new book
a new philosophy
a new way to look
at what plagues us
every second

ultimately
it is up to the human
to realise
they have been practicing
all their life
where has all this practice
led them to
except more practice?
